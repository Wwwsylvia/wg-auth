# OCI Working Group: Auth

## Mission Statement

Authentication and authorization are a key requirement for registries to control access.
Implementations of this in registries and clients have roughly followed standards set by Docker and have mostly focused on compatibility with specific implementations of registries or clients.
This working group will define a standard to be supported by OCI compatible registries and clients when support for authentication and authorization is required.
